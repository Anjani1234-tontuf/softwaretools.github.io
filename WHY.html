this?&nbsp;&nbsp;I was an out of work software engineer with a
working wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a dutiful husband, I made
dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of dinners.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a couple of
months of my existing repertoire of salads, steaks, chops, chicken
and pasta, it was time for a change.</p>

<p class='indent'>I started simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;It did not take long to realize a
recipe does not teach you how to cook.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I found myself
digging through cookbooks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Digging and
digging.&nbsp;&nbsp;I made up the lists for what to shop for and
went off to the store.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops, what kind of ham was
that?&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, looks like I have to make sure I really know
how to select it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, it&rsquo;s time to start.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the difference between dice, mince and
chop?&nbsp;&nbsp;What&rsquo;s medium high?&nbsp;&nbsp;How do tell when the meat is really
"browned" and on and on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago I worked with a
software product called <em>RAMIS</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also
known as "<em>R</em><span class="mythinsp">&nbsp;</span>ead <em>A</em><span class="mythinsp">&nbsp;</span>ll <em>M</em><span class="mythinsp">&nbsp;</span>anuals,
<em>I</em><span class="mythinsp">&nbsp;</span>t&rsquo;s <em>S</em><span class="mythinsp">&nbsp;</span>omeplace".&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s
how I was starting to feel about cooking.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
find out where the following came from, but at this point in my
cooking career, when I read it, well, I didn&rsquo;t know whether
to laugh or cry:</p>


<br>
<p align="center" ><em>I read recipes the same way I read
science fiction.</em></p>

<p align="center" ><em>I get to the end and think, "Well,
that&rsquo;s not going to happen."</em></p>

<br>
<hr class="announce">
<p class='indents'>There are LOTS of resources on Cooking.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are
Cooking Shows galore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Websites &mdash; hundreds. Cookbooks &mdash;
thousands &mdash; maybe millions.</p>

<br class="clearall">

<p><em>I remember:</em></p>
<p class="mythinsp">&nbsp;</p>

<ul class='cb'>
  <li class='anp'><p>Searching cooking websites for a simple Tomato Pasta Sauce.&nbsp; Oops, that&rsquo;s an enormous amount to wade through.<br>
Click, Click, Click, Click, Click, Click, Click, Click, Click,Click, Click&nbsp; "Whats all this, Where is the RECIPE?", Click, Click, Click, Click, Click, Click, Click ...
    </p></li>
  <li class='bnp'><p>seeing a site with video instructions on how to prepare a leg of lamb.&nbsp; Bought the leg.&nbsp; Got home, getting ready &mdash; the page was gone.
    </p></li>
  <li class='anp'><p>watching a show and taking notes.&nbsp; Oops, how did I miss that?&nbsp; What were all those ingredients?&nbsp; Why doesn&rsquo;t mine look or taste like theirs?&nbsp; What gives?
    </p></li>

<hr class="announce">
<p class='indent'>Some cookbooks are pretty good, but way too often, they try and
shoehorn the content into what fits on a page.&nbsp;&nbsp; My
favorite is the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But too often, it
reminds me of <em>RAMIS</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frugal Gourmet has
lots of great ideas, recipes and tips; however, when I am planning
and cooking, its hard to watch TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Galloping
Gourmet, both past and present versions are fun to
watch.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a few websites that will give,
for free, some of the basic information you need to learn to
cook.&nbsp;&nbsp; But they are not integrated, the searches are
often primitive and more often than not, you will do a lot of
clicking (and spend a lot of time) getting what you are looking
for.</p>



<br>
<p class='indent'>But what I wanted was a decent tool, book, website or class that
was geared towards the beginning cook.&nbsp;&nbsp;Something that
imparts the basics, shows you how to actually cook.</p>

<hr class="announce">
<br>
<p class='indent'>I&rsquo;m a big fan of books; I think they&rsquo;re
FANTASTIC.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s great that all that information is
available on all those websites.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s nice that
they have all those television shows on cooking.&nbsp;&nbsp;But
its a lot of information to wade through.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of blind
alleys, too.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not a big fan of PDF files or the
other "Electronic Book" formats.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would rather have the
book.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are reading it on your computer, there is
certainly a lot more you can do to make the reader more productive,
make the presentation more interesting and make looking things up
<em>A LOT EASIER</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In no small part, my motivation
is to provide more and better content, for less.&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew
I could do a better job.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you agree.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you want better vehicles for education, order up a copy of the
<acronym title="Shameless, I know, but look what I am up against">CD.</acronym></p>
