Examples:
1/2 cup in milliliters
3 cups in liters
350 F in C (this will translate Fahrenheit to Celsius)
10 inches in cm
1 teaspoon in ml
1 pound in kg
1 ounce in grams

The Measurement Converter will alas, not convert baking measurements such as teaspoons of baking powder into grams.
For such measurements, follow these conversions:

Baking powder :
1 tablespoon ~= 1 packet/envelope = 11 g

Butter :
1 stick ~ = 1/2 C = 112 g
100 g ~= 1 stick minus a tablespoon

Flour :
1/4 C ~= 30 g
100 g ~= 3/4 C plus one rounded tablespoon
1 C ~= 120 g

Sugar :
100 g ~= 1/3 C + 1 tablespoon
1 C ~= 240 g

I could use an event listener to capture the x and y position
for onclick events


need different class than scenter

  Nice to have
    convert to a fraction ( use frmtNumber )
    reset all button

  Need to check some of the conversions.  tablespoons to weight type things
  Need compact versions for the sidebar


  1) strip headings
  2) scenter to smaller
  3) input styles to smaller
  4) less padding
  5) rows between  full screen

  I may need to create alternate styles like tds (td) for td small

dash      Dashes
pinch       Pinches

add options

1) degrees prescsion radio button 1,2,3,4
2) show nearest 1/8 -(especially good for metric to english
3) turn off fractions

o not bother to change unitl you figure out enter - return key 13
on submit, on change

addEventListener stuff

/*

Need to see fix this when I get key events figured out

function netscapeKeyPress(ev)
{
    if (ev.which == 13)
    {
        alert('enter does nothing here');
    }
}

function microsoftKeyPress()
{
    if (window.event.keyCode == 13)
    {
        alert('enter does nothing here');
    }
}

//capture events is deprecated - does not appear to worl
if (isGecko())
{
    window.captureEvents(Event.KEYPRESS);
    window.onKeyPress = netscapeKeyPress;
}
//need mickey stuff

  // More free form version
  // Count total tokens, Test 1 could check for the presense of an IN and seperate tokens to the left and right
  // Test2,   if over 4 start at left 0, 1 .. combining tokens and test until its NAN,
  // then count remaing,  at most then I should have the combined quantity, 2 for From unit, the In, and 2 for the To Unit
  // if either unit has 2 tokens do a search in the special 2 token list and then equivalence to conversion factors in the
  // one token list, then proceed

  // 4 token version, break out the tokens
  // get the qty and both make sure its a either a number or a fraction  2, .2, 3/4 etc
  // might as well convert the fractions

  //1 cups  to deciliter    [0]   if ..[1] ==  ....[2]
  //2 deciliters to cups    [4]   if ..[1]     ....[2]

  google does not do ambigous ones like

  2 c in ml
  2 c in m  no
  2 c in f  Y

  is C cups or Centigrade

  no dozen   tell them what they can use

  gm = gram
  mg = milligram
  sq = square
  min = minute (60 seconds)
  hr = hour (60 minutes)

  lb - pound
  # - pound

  pk. - peck
  bu. - bushel
  ga g  g is sometimes used for gallons, not grams

  3 arrays matched by position

  keep in synch, you have to add same place in all arrays at same time
  preferably at the end
