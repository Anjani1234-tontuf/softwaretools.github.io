The Double Metaphone algorithm, developed by Lawrence Phillips and published in the June 2000 issue of C/C++ Users Journal, is part of a class of algorithms known as "phonetic matching" or "phonetic encoding" algorithms. These algorithms attempt to detect phonetic ("sounds-like") relationships between words. For example, a phonetic matching algorithm should detect a strong phonetic relationship between "Nelson" and "Nilsen", and no phonetic relationship between "Adam" and "Nelson."

Double Metaphone works by producing one or possibly two phonetic keys, given a word. These keys represent the "sound" of the word. A typical Double Metaphone key is four characters long, as this tends to produce the ideal balance between specificity and generality of results.

The first, or primary, Double Metaphone key represents the American pronunciation of the source word. All words have a primary Double Metaphone key.

The second, or alternate, Double Metaphone key represents an alternate, national pronunciation. For example, many Polish surnames are "Americanized", yielding two possible pronunciations, the original Polish, and the American. For this reason, Double Metaphone computes alternate keys for some words. Note that the vast majority (very roughly, 90%) of words will not yield an alternate key, but when an alternate is computed, it can be pivotal in matching the word.

To compare two words for phonetic similarity, one computes their respective Double Metaphone keys, and then compares each combination:

    * Word 1 Primary - Word 2 Primary
    * Word 1 Primary - Word 2 Alternate
    * Word 1 Alternate - Word 2 Primary
    * Word 1 Alternate - Word 2 Alternate

Obviously if the keys in any of these comparisons are not produced for the given words, the comparisons involving those keys are not performed.

Depending upon which of the above comparisons match, a match strength is computed. If the first comparison matches, the two words have a strong phonetic similarity. If the second or third comparison matches, the two words have a medium phonetic similarity. If the fourth comparison matches, the two words have a minimal phonetic similarity. Depending upon the particular application requirements, one or more match levels may be excluded from match results.

Concordance AKA index
The concordance needs to be able to classify word forms (plurals, capitals and the like into the same reference?

Look up doing a concordance for the entire site and skip the obvious words

The most common approach to full text search is to generate a complete index or concordance for all of the searchable documents. For each word (excepting stop words which are too common to be useful) an entry is made which lists the exact position of every occurrence of it within the database of documents. From such a list it is relatively simple to retrieve all the documents that match a query, without having to scan each document. Although for very small document collections full-text searching can be done by serial scanning, indexing is the preferred method for almost all full-text searching

  search all - this would be the stuff in edit files
  see porter.js for word stemming

Step 0: +

    Search for the longest among the suffixes,

    '
    's
    's'
        and remove if found.

Step 1a:

    Search for the longest among the following suffixes, and perform the action indicated.

    sses
        replace by ss

    ied+   ies*
        replace by i if preceded by more than one letter, otherwise by ie (so ties -> tie, cries -> cri)

    s
        delete if the preceding word part contains a vowel not immediately before the s (so gas and this retain the s, gaps and kiwis lose it)

    us+   ss
        do nothing

Step 1b:

    Search for the longest among the following suffixes, and perform the action indicated.

    eed   eedly+
        replace by ee if in R1

    ed   edly+   ing   ingly+
        delete if the preceding word part contains a vowel, and then
        if the word ends at, bl or iz add e (so luxuriat -> luxuriate), or
        if the word ends with a double remove the last letter (so hopp -> hop), or
        if the word is short, add e (so hop -> hope)


Steming

Stem certain special words as follows,

    skis      ->      ski
    skies       ->      sky
    dying
    lying
    tying     ->    die
    lie
    tie
    idly
    gently
    ugly
    early
    only
    singly    ->    idl
    gentl
    ugli
    earli
    onli
    singl


And indeed the  exception1  routine for the English stemmer has just that shape:

    define exception1 as (

         [substring] atlimit among(

            /* special changes: */

            'skis'      (<-'ski')
            'skies'     (<-'sky')
            'dying'     (<-'die')
            'lying'     (<-'lie')
            'tying'     (<-'tie')

            /* special -LY cases */

            'idly'      (<-'idl')
            'gently'    (<-'gentl')
            'ugly'      (<-'ugli')
            'early'     (<-'earli')
            'only'      (<-'onli')
            'singly'    (<-'singl')

            // ... extensions possible here ...

            /* invariant forms: */

            'sky'
            'news'
            'howe'

            'atlas' 'cosmos' 'bias' 'andes' // not plural forms

            // ... extensions possible here ...
        )
    )

  SimpleSearch fails because of crtdebug stuff ?

  Cilantro, Coriander and Coriander Leaves should all refer back to Coriander

  name is the french spelling
  aïoli

  synonyms  Aioli, aiòli

  Aioli
  Aioli — aïoli (French spelling) or aiòli (Modern Provençal spelling) from the Provençal aiet ("garlic") and oli ("oil"),  is a cold sauce made of garlic, egg, acid (lemon juice or vinegar), and olive oil, basically a garlic-flavoured       mayonnaise.

  In Provence, aioli also designates a complete dish consisting of boiled vegetables (carrots, potatoes..., green beans), boiled fish (normally, desalted cod), and boiled eggs served with the aioli sauce.
