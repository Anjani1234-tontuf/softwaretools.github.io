Content Notes

a day begins at midnight

its incorrect to refer to 12 am or pm
its is either 12 noon or 12 mid night

the start of the day is 00:00
the end of the day is 24:00
the end of one day is the start of another
http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/what.html   Time service

How about playing a system sound when you cross the 1 minute barrier?
If alarm time > 4 minutes, play = false,  if played and less than 60
played=true , playsystem sound

To populate a list of files to uses as alarms
have them drag wav files to a directory.

populate a list or a grid from the elements in the directory

see garymenudriver and ttrw2.js

to add a Count Down timer event from another page

set a button to make this visible

or


  callExternalAlarm(0,0,0,1,1,"My Alarm", 'CountDownTime',1 );

  Writes a cookie that is read from Timer.html

-> Somehow a Timer.html needs to be made active to process the alarm and set the off

only allows my preset wav files

pref("dom.disable_open_during_load",true);

This really says, don't allow Javascript to open unreguested windows.
And it stops you from doing it, if the event chain is all Javascript

However, it is smart enough to figure out that if you click on a button to start an event, its okay to pop up a window.


Changed it to false and it started working

pref("dom.disable_open_during_load",false);

also
I thought previously it had to do with this
Preferences

pref.js in user directory

user_pref("capability.principal.codebase.p4.granted", "UniversalXPConnect UniversalBrowserWrite");
user_pref("capability.principal.codebase.p4.id", " ../XXSoftwareTools/Timer.html");

however, using mozilla when this was loaded from a web site , UniverslXPconnect was denied

gBrowser.selectedTab = theTab;


the createElement code is called before there is a body.
its working, but when I added a create embed, that failed, see note in startup below


Hibernate sleep suspend
the power aware application
==================

Use SetThreadExecutionState

SetSystemPowerState

Suspends the system by shutting power down. Depending on the ForceFlag parameter, the function either suspends operation immediately or requests permission from all applications and device drivers before doing so.


BOOL SetSystemPowerState(
BOOL fSuspend,
BOOL fForce
);

Parameters
fSuspend
[in] If this parameter is TRUE, the system is suspended. If the parameter is FALSE, the system hibernates.
fForce
[in] If this parameter is TRUE, the function broadcasts a PBT_APMSUSPEND event to each application and driver, then immediately suspends operation. If the parameter is FALSE, the function broadcasts a PBT_APMQUERYSUSPEND event to each application to request permission to suspend operation.

MSDN
Power Manager Functions
Power Manager Reference

Retrieves information about the system power capabilities.


BOOLEAN GetPwrCapabilities(
PSYSTEM_POWER_CAPABILITIES lpSystemPowerCapabilities
);

Parameters
lpSystemPowerCapabilities
[out] A pointer to a SYSTEM_POWER_CAPABILITIES structure that receives the information.
Return Value
If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.

If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call GetLastError.

Remarks
This function retrieves detailed information about the current system power management hardware resources and capabilities. This includes information about the presence of hardware features such as power buttons, lid switches, and batteries. Other details returned include information about current power management capabilities and configurations that can change dynamically, such as the minimum sleep state currently supported, which may change as new drivers are introduced into the system, or the presence of the system hibernation file.

This information is also available through the CallNtPowerInformation function, using the SystemPowerCapabilities level.

For more information on using PowrProf.h, see Power Schemes.



New shutdown process
Application developers need to be aware of changes in the shutdown process in Windows Vista. The net result is that when users want to turn off their computers, they're much more likely to get what they ask for.

Prior to Windows Vista, an application could veto a sleep transition by responding to the PBT_APMQUERYSUSPEND power broadcast. Now, applications cannot veto sleep transitions, although system administrators can allow applications to veto sleep transitions by using Group Policy.)

Applications can still veto a shutdown by responding to the WM_QUERYENDSESSION message. However, Windows Vista provides a user interface for managing applications that are blocking shutdown.

Applications can provide a descriptive string that explains why they're vetoing shutdown. For more information about creating the string for the shutdown procedure, see ShutdownBlockReasonCreate()ShutdownBlockReasonCreate().

Applications that don't have a top-level window or that stop responding are automatically closed when the computer is shutting down.

The following screen shot shows two applications that are blocking Windows from shutting down.


SetSystemPowerState

ShutdownBlockReasonCreate

Indicates that the system cannot be shut down and sets a reason string to be displayed to the user if system shutdown is initiated.


BOOL WINAPI ShutdownBlockReasonCreate(
HWND hWnd,
LPCWSTR pwszReason
);

Power management interfaces
Windows Vista uses the WM_POWERBROADCAST window message to notify applications about power management events. The message includes a set of power broadcast codes that identify the various events. You can subscribe to these events by using two new functions that are introduced in Windows Vista:

RegisterPowerSettingNotificationRegisterPowerSettingNotification

UnregisterPowerSettingNotificationUnregisterPowerSettingNotification

Power management notifications provide complete information about the power management status of the system and its components. By using notifications, your application eliminates the need to poll the system, which drains energy.


=======
Avoid delaying idle-to-sleep
One key user expectation is that the computer will observe idle time-outs. People expect their computers to shut down display and storage devices and go to sleep after requested idle periods.

In certain rare instances, an ongoing process might take precedence over an idle-to-sleep setting. For example, if a media application is burning a CD (which would be ruined if the process were interrupted), the application might temporarily disable the idle-mode time-out, and then restore the time-out after it finishes burning the CD.

You can use the SetThreadExecutionState function to disable the idle-to-sleep and display-blanking time-outs. However, disable these time-out periods only if absolutely necessary, such as when data or media loss will occur, or when there are special "hands-off" scenarios, such as watching a movie. Be sure to restore the time-out periods after your operation is completed.

http://kb.mozillazine.org/Video_or_audio_does_not_play

Plugins

Background music usually needs a plugin to work in Mozilla browsers. The Windows Media Player plugin will only play Microsoft's proprietary audio formats and so will not play Wave and Midi files. (Internet Explorer does not use the Windows Media Player plugin; instead it uses an ActiveX control which provides much more functionality than the plugin.) For Mozilla Suite and Firefox users, Quicktime is often the required plugin. Make sure you have Quicktime installed and that the Quicktime browser settings are configured to enable the plugin for the type of media the page uses.

http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/windows.html


Plugins 101 - Each plugin has a list of file extensions and MIME Types it can play. Firefox sticks rigidly to these lists - it will never assume that a plugin can play a file type it does not list.


The Windows Media Player plugin only lists these file types: .asf, .asx, .wm, .wma, .wax, .wmv, and .wvx (and their associated MIME Types). Neither the WMP plugin, the Quicktime plugin, or the Real Player plugin list the commonly used media formats, like mp3, m3u, wav, midi, etc - so, Firefox cannot find a plugin to play those files if it comes across them. It works in IE because IE doesn't use the WMP plugin (which is 6 years old now) - it uses the newer WMP ActiveX control, which works differently. IE will use it to play any media format that WMP itself can play.
The WMP plugin is capable of playing anything that WMP itself can play - the trick is getting it to. A MIME Type is an identifier sent with each file on the internet (e.g. the MIME Type for a web page is text/html) - a browser is supposed to use the MIME Type to decide how to treat a file - this should have allowed a website author to force a browser to treat specific files specific ways (by giving those files specific MIME Types), and would have been very useful. But it never worked, because IE ignores MIME Types and instead analyses the content of a file to decide for itself what should be done with it. This is bad for many reasons.

Firefox, does use MIME Types to decide what to do with files. The embed tag supports the type attribute, which allows a page author to specify a specific MIME Type which will override the MIME Type of the file to be played, effectively allowing the page author to choose which plugin a browser will use to play the file without changing the MIME Type of the file itself. The MIME Type application/x-mplayer2 is associated with the WMP plugin, but not to any file extension. If you specify type="application/x-mplayer2" in yor embed statement, Firefox will use the WMP plugin to play it.
The WMP plugin is old, and doesn't support as much stuff as the ActiveX control. For instance, it doesn't support attribute values of "true" and "false" - (apart from the playcount attribute) - you must use "1" and "0" instead - that's why autostart="true" is now autostart="1". It doesn't support the loop attribute - you must use playcount instead.
style='display:none' is one way of hiding things. I don't know if it would work for a media file, but a simpler way is to just set the width and height to 0, as I did. There is a 'hidden' attribute, but it prevents the WMP plugin from autostarting.


Webpage authors: To make your site play background music in Mozilla applications using the Windows Media Player plugin, add (MIME) type "application/x-mplayer2", set height and width to "0" to hide it, and set the "autostart" value to "1" (explanation). Here is a standards-compliant, cross-browser object example:

<object data="music.mp3" type="application/x-mplayer2" width="0" height="0">
  <param name="filename" value="music.mp3">
  <param name="autostart" value="1">
  <param name="playcount" value="true">
</object>

This will be hidden, play automatically and loop forever.

Technical Notes Linux

Need help for installing wav plugin for FireFox
well you can install a few packages to help you out.
To start try this link:
https:  help.ubuntu.com community Medibuntu
Medibuntu will aid you in getting things like the win32codecs you will need.
Then I suggest installing mozilla-mplayer, it too might help getting these files to play.
If you need help on installing these packages just ask

sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer
