<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. Distribution Obligations. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.1. Application of License.
<br>
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by
the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The
Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of
this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1,
and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.2. Availability of Source Code. <br>
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if
made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for
at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at
least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.3. Description of Modifications. <br>
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of
any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is
derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source
Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(a) Third Party Claims. <br>
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source
Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party
making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the
LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
knowledge has been obtained. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(b) Contributor APIs. <br>
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and
Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to
implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL
file. <br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>(c) Representations. </p>

<p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor
has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>

<p><br>
3.5. Required Notices. <br>
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
Code.&nbsp; If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location
(such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a
notice.&nbsp; If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name
as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.&nbsp; You must
also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.&nbsp;
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. <br>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include
a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You
have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating
to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code
or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.7. Larger Works. <br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
